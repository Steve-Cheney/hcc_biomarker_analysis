# Integrative Transcriptomic and Functional Analysis Reveals Biomarkers for HCC Diagnosis and Prognosis

## Abstract

Liver cancer, predominantly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This study leverages the GSE25097 transcriptomic dataset to identify novel biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. Differential expression analysis revealed 12 key genes–ANLN, BUB1, DLGAP5, KIF23, NDC80, ORC6L, PRC1, PTTG1, SKA1, TOP2A, TTK, and UBE2C—exhibiting perfect classification performance (AUC = 1.0) in distinguishing tumor from normal tissues. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted pathways associated with chromosome segregation, nuclear division, and cell cycle regulation, underscoring their relevance to tumorigenesis. Among these, ORC6L emerged as a promising, yet underexplored, candidate biomarker in HCC, previously associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. These findings emphasize the need for further validation of these biomarkers across diverse platforms and cohorts, with potential applications in early detection and personalized treatment strategies for liver cancer.
